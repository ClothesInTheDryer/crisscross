## CrissCross

*A custom web interface for running SSRS reports, based on the SSRS Web Services and SSRS ReportViewer component.*

## About

CrissCross is an open-source ASP.NET application that provides an alternative front-end for running SSRS Reports.
That is, a way of running SSRS reports that is like the 'Report Manager' that comes with SSRS, but different
and more customisable. It is built using the standard ASP.NET ReportViewer component and the SSRS web services.

## Compatibility

The latest version of CrissCross is designed to connect to SQL 2014 SSRS.
It should also work with older (and possibly newer) versions of SSRS with little or no adjustment.

It is written in ASP.NET 4.5 and can run on most recent versions of IIS and hence most Windows Servers.
Works with all the main browsers.

For compatibiltiy info for older versions of CrissCross, see [Changelog](https://github.com/codeulike/crisscross/wiki/Changelog)

## Latest Version

Current version is a Beta version of the software - most of the core features are working and stable, but there may be occasional bugs (see documentation). It is however being used in production in at least two sites that I know of.
