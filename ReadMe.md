CrissCross
----------

CrissCross is an open-source ASP.NET application that provides an alternative front-end for running SSRS Reports. That is, a way of running SSRS reports that is like the 'Report Manager' that comes with SSRS, but different
and more customisable. It is built using the standard ASP.NET ReportViewer component and the SSRS web services.

It is also hosted on [Codeplex](http://crisscross.codeplex.com/).
