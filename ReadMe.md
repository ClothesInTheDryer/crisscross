## CrissCross

*A custom web interface for running SSRS reports, based on the SSRS Web Services and SSRS ReportViewer component.*

## About

CrissCross is an open-source ASP.NET application that provides an alternative front-end for running SSRS Reports.
That is, a way of running SSRS reports that is like the 'Report Manager' that comes with SSRS, but different
and more customisable. It is built using the standard ASP.NET ReportViewer component and the SSRS web services.

## Compatibility

(its quite old, this is how things were last time I checked)

CrissCross is designed to connect to SQL 2008 SSRS. SQL 2005 SSRS and SQL 2008 R2 SSRS also work.

It is written in ASP.NET 3.5 and can run on most recent versions of IIS and hence most Windows Servers.
Works with all the main browsers, but because it uses the Microsoft ReportViewer ASP.NET component, some features work better in IE (7,8 or 9)

## Latest Version

Current version is a Beta version of the software - most of the core features are working and stable, but there may be occasional bugs (see documentation). It is however being used in production in at least two sites that I know of.
